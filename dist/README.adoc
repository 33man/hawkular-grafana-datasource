== Configuration

The datasource URL must point to the Hawkular Metrics service, e.g. `http://myhost:8080/hawkular/metrics`

`direct` access mode only works with standalone Metrics servers currently. If you activate it, make sure to allow
the Grafana server origin in Metrics' configuration.

Authentication must be set when working with a Hawkular server. Check the `Basic Auth` box and fill the user and password fields.

Eventually, select the tenant. On Hawkular servers, use `hawkular`.

== Building

You need `npm` and `grunt` to build the project.

== Known issues

=== Error when selecting a metric collected by the Hawkular Agent

When working with a Hawkular server, it is currently not possible to display metrics collected by the Hawkular agent.
This is due to the presence of slashes in metric names.
